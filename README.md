# Module-6-Challenge-Weather-Challenge

## Description

I created this Weather Dashboard to allow users to input their desired city and see a current forecast, alongside a forecast for the next 5 days. They can also see all of their recent searches under the search bar, in case they would like to come back to a previous search. With this app, users no longer have to worry about what the weather will look like! They can simply search by city name and get all relevant information. Thanks to the help of Open Weather API, I was able to make this application! I was able to showcase my skills using APIs and navigating those APIs to generate relevant data to the page.

## Usage

2. Input desired city into search bar labeled "Search for a City"
3. Current date's forecast will display in the first section, showing the temperature, wind, and humidity. Below the current date forecast, the 5-day forecast will populate with the same information as the current date forecast.
4. recent searches will be generated and displayed under search bar for reference.
