# Module-6-Challenge-Weather-Challenge

## Description

I created this Weather Dashboard to allow users to input their desired city and see a current forecast, alongside a forecast for the next 5 days. They can see all of their recent searches under the search bar, in case they would like to come back to a previous search. With this app, users no longer have to worry about what the weather will look like! They can simply search by city name and get all relevant information. Thanks to the help of Open Weather API, I was able to make this application

I created this Work Day Scheduler to allow for users to have a time management tool whilst at work. The main problem this solves is a lack of organization that some people may have when it comes to their schedule. This tool allows for a user to add events into a given hour slot on the calendar and save it. On refresh, their events will remain in the corresponding hour blocks. This tool is also color coordinated, with past event blocks showing as gray, present event blocks as red, and future event blocks as green. During this project, I was able to further strengthen my skills in event delegation and local storage. I also used for loops and if statements to allow for functionality.

## Usage

1. Open Password Generator at (https://simonmagidenko.github.io/Module-5-Challenge-Work-Day-Scheduler/)
2. Input events in according time blocks for that given day/date
3. Past events will be gray, present events will be red, and future events will be green.
4. Save events using the save icon to the right of each corresponding time block.
5. Events will now save and not disappear on refresh, allowing for this page to be opened and closed.
